Mission:    Suicide has become a plague among the world claiming millions of
    lives every year. Victims aren't taken serious when they reach out for
    help or we don't see the signs leading up to the tragic event. Let's 
    raise more awareness to decrease, if not eliminate, the suicide rate. 
    Lets start saving lives.


Vision:     The Semi-Colon Project is a non-profit organization that has an easy-to-navigate website providing visitors with help during times of self help emergencies or deep sorrow. The Semi-Colon Project will cater to people within the vicinity of approximately 50 miles of the Dayton Beach Area with hopes to expand nationwide. Weâ€™ll be helping them connect with people who can help talk them out of serious self harm, suicide ideation or just be a friend in a time of need. We also will assist in directing those in need to a safe house where they will be provided shelter, meals, clothing, hygeine, counseling, medical needs, and anonymity. Suicide has only increased in taking the lives of our loved ones over the years as well as tortured our own minds perhaps. Our organization wants to do anything possible to reduce, if not eliminate the suicide rate.
